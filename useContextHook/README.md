# useContext Hook

- used to consumed values (like data or functions) from a context created createContext()
- It allows functional components to access context values without prop drilling
- goto: (https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_usecontext.asp) for better understanding with example
- It can be used together with the useState Hook to share state between deeply nested components more easily than with useState alone.
- We can have multiple useContext in React
