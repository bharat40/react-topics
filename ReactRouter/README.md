# ReactRouter

- React Router enables "client side routing"
- If I switch page there will be no refresh to the page and we will be routed to another page
- Client side routing allows our app to update the URL from a link without making any request for any document from the server.
- Instead, our app can immediately render some new UI and make data requests with fetch to update the page with new information.
